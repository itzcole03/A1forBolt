## Overview

This directory contains layout components for the frontend application. Layouts define the structural composition and shared UI elements for different sections of the app, ensuring consistency and reusability across pages and features.

## File Breakdown

### MainLayout.tsx
- **Purpose:** Provides the primary structure for authenticated or main application pages, including navigation and sidebar.
- **Usage:** Wraps main content with a Navbar at the top, a Sidebar on the side, and a main content area that renders nested routes via `<Outlet />` from react-router-dom.
- **Notes:** Uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Centralizes header, sidebar, and main content logic. Ensures a consistent layout for all main app pages.
- **Status:** Actively used; not a candidate for removal.

### AuthLayout.tsx
- **Purpose:** Defines a focused, centered layout for authentication-related pages (e.g., login, signup, password reset).
- **Usage:** Displays a logo and heading, and renders nested routes (such as authentication forms) via `<Outlet />` from react-router-dom.
- **Notes:** Uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Ensures a clean, distraction-free experience for authentication flows. Includes branding (logo and app name) at the top.
- **Status:** Actively used; not a candidate for removal.
