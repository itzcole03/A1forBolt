# Types Directory

This directory contains all TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for the application.

- Each file defines types, interfaces, and enums for a specific domain (e.g., betting, ML, prediction, etc.).
- Shared and global types are in `shared.ts` and `global.d.ts`.
- All types are used throughout the frontend and services for type safety.

## Example Type Files
- `betting.ts`: Types for betting opportunities and configs.
- `ml.ts`: Types for machine learning models and results.
- `prediction.ts`: Types for prediction results and payloads.
- `shared.ts`: Common/shared types.
