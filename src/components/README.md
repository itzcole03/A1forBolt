# Components Directory

This directory contains all React UI components for the application, organized by feature and domain.

- Subfolders group related components (e.g., `analytics/`, `betting/`, `ml/`, `prediction/`, etc.).
- Each subfolder contains a `README.md` describing its contents and intended usage.
- Shared UI elements (buttons, cards, modals, etc.) are in `common/` or `ui/`.
- All components are written in TypeScript/TSX unless otherwise noted.
- Test files are in `__tests__/` subfolders.
