## Overview

This directory contains Python modules for system analysis, including performance, resource, and security analysis. Each module provides logic for analyzing collected system metrics and generating insights or health scores. These modules are designed for extensibility and integration with a broader system analysis tool.

## File Breakdown

### performance.py
- **Purpose:** Implements the PerformanceAnalyzer class for analyzing system performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network, processes) and providing health insights.
- **Usage:** Used to process collected metrics, compare them to configurable thresholds, and generate warnings or critical alerts.
- **Notes:** Integrates with a Config object for dynamic thresholds. Calculates overall system health score.
- **Status:** Actively used; not a candidate for removal.

### resources.py
- **Purpose:** Implements the ResourceAnalyzer class for analyzing system resource utilization (disk, memory, swap, file system, processes) and providing health insights.
- **Usage:** Used to process collected resource metrics, compare them to configurable thresholds, and generate warnings or critical alerts.
- **Notes:** Integrates with a Config object for dynamic thresholds. Calculates overall resource health score.
- **Status:** Actively used; not a candidate for removal.

### security.py
- **Purpose:** Implements the SecurityAnalyzer class for analyzing system security metrics (ports, services, updates, firewall, antivirus, SSL certificates) and providing security scores.
- **Usage:** Used to process collected security metrics, check for vulnerabilities, and generate warnings or critical alerts.
- **Notes:** Integrates with a Config object for dynamic checks. Calculates overall security score.
- **Status:** Actively used; not a candidate for removal.
