## Overview

This directory is intended to contain core analytics and feature engineering modules for the frontend. As of now, most files are placeholders or stubs for future migration and refactoring from a legacy workspace. The folder will eventually support feature engineering, selection, validation, transformation, monitoring, caching, and registry logic for the analytics pipeline.
