## File Breakdown

### utils.ts
- **Purpose:** Exports the `cn` function, which merges Tailwind CSS class names using `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for conditional and deduplicated class composition.
- **Usage:** Used throughout the frontend to combine and deduplicate class names for React components, especially when using Tailwind CSS.
- **Notes:** Leverages `clsx` for conditional class logic and `tailwind-merge` for resolving Tailwind class conflicts.
- **Status:** Actively used; not a candidate for removal.
