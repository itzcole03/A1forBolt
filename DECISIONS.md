# Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

- **Switched from stubbed validation to zod** for runtime type safety and developer experience.
- **Upgraded Node.js and npm** to support modern dependencies and tooling.
- **Removed all legacy stubs and TODOs** in favor of production-ready, type-safe code.
- **Standardized on ESLint (Airbnb/Prettier) and Jest** for code quality and testing.
- **Documented all modules and APIs** for traceability and onboarding.
- **Automated documentation and changelog updates** for every major change.
